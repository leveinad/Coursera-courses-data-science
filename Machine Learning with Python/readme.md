# Machine Learning with Python
This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 
In this course, we will be reviewing two main components:
First, I will learn about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, I will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, I practice with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects society in ways I may not have guessed!

This is what I have learned:
1) New skills, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy 
2) New projects, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
