# Tools for Data Science
What are some of the most popular data science tools, how do we use them, and what are their features? In this course, I have learnt about Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, and Watson Studio. I have learnt about what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Skills Network Labs, I am able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala. To end the course, I create a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio and demonstrate my proficiency preparing a notebook, writing Markdown, and sharing my work with my peers.
