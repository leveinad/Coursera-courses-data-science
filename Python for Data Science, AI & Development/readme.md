# Python for Data Science, AI & Development
Kickstart my learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general, with this beginner-friendly introduction to Python. Python is one of the world’s most popular programming languages, and there has never been greater demand for professionals with the ability to apply Python fundamentals to drive business solutions across industries. 

This course took me from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours—no prior programming experience necessary! I learnt Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate my new skills. 

By the end of this course, I have felt comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python. I have gained a strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, and develop skills to help advance my career.
